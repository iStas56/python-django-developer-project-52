## About

A task management web application built with Python and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. It allows you to set tasks, assign performers and change their statuses. Registration and authentication are required to work with the system.

To provide users with a convenient, adaptive, modern interface, the project uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

The frontend is rendered on the backend. This means that the page is built by the DjangoTemplates backend, which returns prepared HTML. And this HTML is rendered by the server.

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used as the object-relational database system.

### Details

For **_user_** authentication, the standard Django tools are used. In this project, users will be authorized for all actions, that is, everything is available to everyone.

Each task in the task manager usually has a **_status_**. With its help you can understand what is happening to the task, whether it is done or not. Tasks can be, for example, in the following statuses: _new, in progress, in testing, completed_.

**_Tasks_** are the main entity in any task manager. A task consists of a name and a description. Each task can have a person to whom it is assigned. It is assumed that this person performs the task. Also, each task has mandatory fields - author (set automatically when creating the task) and status.

**_Labels_** are a flexible alternative to categories. They allow you to group the tasks by different characteristics, such as bugs, features, and so on. Labels are related to the task of relating many to many.

When the tasks become numerous, it becomes difficult to navigate through them. For this purpose, a **_filtering mechanism_** has been implemented, which has the ability to filter tasks by status, performer, label presence, and has the ability to display tasks whose author is the current user.
